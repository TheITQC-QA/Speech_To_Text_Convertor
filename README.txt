We need to install few packages to convert speech into text and saved in document file
-------------------------------------------------------------

1- "SpeechRecognition" for Converting an audio/speech into text

	pip install SpeechRecognition

---------------------------------------------------------------

2- "docx" is to write into MS word document

    pip install python-docx
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------

This program will ask you to select file type option in which format would you like to save your speech :- 

Press 1 :-  for MS Word Document 
Press 2 :-  for Notepad Document

enter 1 or 2 and press enter (for other type it won't save your speech)

*You can start speaking once you see (it will take few second 2/3 second)

	Let's Start Speaking......... 

Once you take more than 5 second pause, Progam is considering you are done !!!
